Have a great day!

  <dd><p>Well, this is where things started to get out of hand. Initially I was a bit preoccupied to properly figure the nature of the task. So, when I was a couple of hours in and decided to read the task again I was very greedy just to scrap it all. That's why it is here. </p></dd>
  <dt>Test Task 2 - <a href = "https://gorest.co.in/">REST API for Testing and Prototyping</a></dt>
  <dd><p>So, when I approached the most meaningful part of task I was able to discover some biggest lacks: 
  <ul>
  <li>My grasp of async functions (for Postman in particular) lacks</li>
  <li>I do not have a good idea of how a properly written and built Postman collection looks like (comments, folders, variable names: all sorts of conventions)</li>
  <li>It is benefitial to be able to describe crucial request attributes in console (especially POST, PUT)</li>
  <li><a href = "https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/test-examples">POSTMAN: Test script examples</a> is a place to start the journey, not to end :)</li>
